## Intro to ThreeJS
#### Sunday, February 28: 6pm-8pm, Room 006 in the Art Center
Are you interested in creating 3D visualizations and animations for the web. In this workshop, we'll introduce threeJS, a javascript library for creating 3D content in the browser. Some basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and javascript is preferred but not required. Please bring a laptop!

## Serial Communication (Hardware + Software, Oh My!)
#### Sunday, February 21: 6pm-8pm, Room 006 in the Art Center
If you've been following along with the previous 2 weeks of workshops, this is the best one yet!

## Theater Tech II: Hacking the Stage
#### Sunday, November 8: 6pm-8pm, Room 006 in the Art Center
Cameras, microphones, projectors... they've appeared in theater productions before. But how can we use them in new, exciting ways? How can we push them in ways they aren't supposed to be pushed? How can technology affect an actor, a scene and a theatrical moment? How do we make technology into an actor and not a gimmick? Building on the work in Isadora, and examining the work of companies like Wooster Group and Forced Entertainment, students will begin to mess with (and hack!) the different technologies we take for granted on stage and in performance.

## Unity 3D Workshop Part 1
#### Sunday, November 1: 6pm-8pm, Room 006 in the Art Center
GAF James Hosken will guide you through the basics of the Unity 3D game engine. If you've ever wanted to design a video game, this is your chance to get started! Bring a laptop and download Unity from the website.

## Switch Off Your Eyes
#### Sunday, September 27: 6pm-8pm, Room 006 in the Art Center
Fari Bradley - Silence in talkies, noise in romance. Did cinema pave the way for abstract and unpalatable sound as an art form by rejecting a narrative, or did certain films do so instead to move towards a 'meta-narrative'. Which directors employed sound art in a way that it became one of the characters in the plot?

## Chris Weaver- Contact Microphones. 
Learn how to use microphones to record objects and devices to get unique sounds from the world around you!
