# Immediate next steps

- Update responsiveness
  - Actionable buttons section needs to be changed for portrait screens
  - Sketch area needs to be changed for portrait screens (Are we attempting to keep the 16x9ish aspect for portrait screens, or mandating that the sketches themselves must be responsive, OR asking for vertical sketches as well?)
- Add temporary sketch
- Convert current divs to useful tags (buttons, links, etc)

# Future goals

- Create overlay system for actionable buttons
