# Immediate next steps

- [RE: overlays] fill out templates for the other two overlays (Examples and Participation)

- [RE: subpages] Create outline pages for About, Academics, Activities

# Future goals

- [RE: Posting to Activities page] Incorporate Google Apps CMS to allow easy update posts events page

- [RE: Quickinks dropdown] add nested dropdowns for class link (for now a separate page will have to do)

## Partially Completed

- [RE: p5 sketch on landing page] Create p5 API that facilitates third party creation of responsive sketches

## Completed

- [RE: REsponsiveness] Responsive Header: Turn 'About|Academics|Activities' into a drop down menu below certain widths.

- [RE: Responsiveness] Update responsiveness
  - Actionable buttons section needs to be changed for portrait screens
  - Sketch area needs to be changed for portrait screens (Are we attempting to keep the 16x9ish aspect for portrait screens, or mandating that the sketches themselves must be responsive, OR asking for vertical sketches as well?)

- [RE: Main  Sketch] Add temporary sketch

- [RE: Usability] Convert current divs to useful tags (buttons, links, etc)

- [RE: Overlays] Create overlay system for actionable buttons
