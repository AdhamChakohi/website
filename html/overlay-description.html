		<!-- A brief description of IM -->
		<p>The Interactive Media program begins with the premise that access to newer and more expansive communication technologies creates new opportunities for human expression. But this <b>major</b> takes the tools as a means of expression — not an end in themselves. The goal of this endeavor is to augment and improve human experience, and to bring both meaning and delight to people's lives.</p>

		<p>The ways that we communicate with one another change all the time. New media technologies are constantly transforming the means of social communication, making them accessible to more and more people. In this process of democratization of the tools of communication, what does it mean to become producers of experiences and not just consumers?</p>
		<p>The Interactive Media program begins with the premise that access to newer and more expansive communication technologies creates new opportunities for human expression. But this concentration takes the tools as a means of expression — not an end in themselves. In Interactive Media courses, students are expected to engage with the ideas offered by their coursework in the core curriculum and in their majors and imagine how those ideas might be communicated with new media technologies. The goal of this endeavor is to augment and improve human experience, and to bring both meaning and delight to people's lives.</p>
		<p>The program's curriculum will be ever-evolving, reflecting the spirit of experimentation and the potential in these emergent forms. Practical skills involving electronics, programming, design, and digital media will be developed in conjunction with theory to address the nature of a constantly changing media landscape.</p>
		<p>The Interactive Media program is also designed as a meeting point for the arts, sciences, and humanities. This integrated approach is part of the program's DNA, facilitating an environment where people from diverse backgrounds can come together to imagine new possibilities for expression.</p> -->

		<!-- A... different description of IM: -->
		<!-- 
		<p >Interactive Media is the place where magical unicorns are assigned their souls. The process involves the technical proficiencies of engineering, the logical thought of computer science, and the creative expression of the arts. </p>

		<p >Once we have assigned a unicorn its soul, the unicorn is free to frolic in the wild, or return to civilisation and become a contributing member of society. Most unicorns that leave IM with a soul end up channelling their inherent goodness to tackle modern society's most horrific demons.</p>

		<p > The power struggle is in its infancy, but our unicorns have already succeeded in defeating Comic Sans and ridding Saadiyat Island of its drone infestation. The focus now shifts towards thwarting thoughtless LED usage and placing piezo buzzers in the Social Science's fedoras.</p>
